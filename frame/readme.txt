Figure 1. Overview of the study design. 
This study consists of three major components: (1) benchmarking structure prediction accuracy of five models, (2) developing prediction quality classifiers, and (3) evaluating and validation of downstream applications of structural and embedding clustering antigen-specific TCRs. Firstly, 51 high-quality TCR crystal structures were curated as a benchmark dataset and used to evaluate five prediction modelsAF2.3, TCRmodel2, AF3, ESMfoldv1 and tfold-TCR in both single-chain and paired-chain modes. Next, predictions generated by AF3 and tfold-TCR were labeled as high- or non-high-quality, and combined cutoffs were optimized using 3-fold cross validation, achieving strong mean ROC-AUC performance; Finally, predicted structures and structural embedding from these two models were applied to a dataset of peptide-specific TCRs to assess clustering and functional characterization capabilities, the screened TCR candidates were validated with a series of experiment.
